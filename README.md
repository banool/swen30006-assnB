# Mailbot 2: Judgement Day

## Results
Final Result: 9/11

> Good work on the report! Class diagram is disjoint (it shouldn't be), it is also missing some association and multiplicities. For the sequence and state diagrams, when you want to refer to a more detailed part of the diagram, you need to add a reference sign on the main one (see http://www.uml-diagrams.org/sequence-diagrams.html the ref part). Your lifeline in the Sequence Diagram should go all the way down (unless it is destroyed). Different behaviour for Small_Comms_Smart.
